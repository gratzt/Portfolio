# Welcome

Hi, I'm Trevor Gratz, a data scientist with experience in predictive analytics, causal inference, and analyses that foster data-informed decision-making and enhance operational efficiency. I have a background in mathematics, statistics, and data analytics, and I've worked in academia and the public sector. I received my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Statistics in 2014 from the University of Washington and my Master of Science in Data Analytics from Georgia Tech in August, 2025. I have over a decade of work experience in data analytics and am a co-author on over ten peer-reviewed [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X7r0bxsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) cited by more than 500 journal articles.

## Featured Projects

Here are a few highlighted projects that demonstrate my capabilities:

#### Building scalable data infrastructure for behavioral health program evaluation


Spearheaded the complete redesign of Pierce County's behavioral health data system, expanding from 7 to 27 participating providers. Established client-level tracking for over 90,000 services across 16,000 clients and counting, while developing comprehensive data collection protocols and quality assurance systems to support outcome evaluations.
